<h1><b>Personal Information</b></h1>
<p> Name: Le Tung Linh <br>
    Student ID: s3846168 <br>
    Email: potatomarshall@gmail.com <br>
    I was born in Hai Phong and I moved to Ho Chi Minh city with my family when I was 4. I will be 23 years old this year. <br>
    I crave a huge love for heavy metal music (especially Death & Black metal) and I love playing Cooperative video games with my friends. <br></p>
<h2><b>Interest in IT</b></h2>
<p> I am fascinated in video games, modding games in particular. Modding games is about changing codes, textures, animations to replace the base game's look.
  The more I learn about it, the more I can change the way the game to fit my taste and not being tighted by the Devloper's designs. I also interested in human & weapons animating since both are crucial to video games. <br>
  There are some time stamps that I got dragged in modding. The first time is when I was 14 years old I discovered a website that has thoundsands of custom-made weapons models and texture for Counter Strike 1.6. The installation is quite easy, I just need to copy the new "skins" and replace the original game files. The second time is last year, a friend that I knew on Steam offered to help me with porting models & animations to Left 4 Dead 2, which I can never thank enough.
  I always obsessed with firearms because of their designs and details (I am against shooting others though) so discovering Modding really ignites my interest.<br>
  <p>I choose to come to RMIT and study IT in hope for getting to know more about computer basics, coding, animations making, designing which I think will benefit for video games making.<br>
<h2><b>Ideal Jobs</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/unity-3d-games-dev-hyper-casual-games-goodia-viet-nam-0423">unity-3d-games-dev-hyper-casual-games-goodia-viet-nam-0423</a>
   This position is game development, in my opinion is the process of making video game with a wide range of works: render, program, engineer, record, mix, produce test,etc. This position can help me alot in expanding my overall knowledge about games and bringing my own ideas to the project.<br>
   Game development has many requirements:<br>
   - Mastered C# program and basic matrix.<br>
   - At least 2 years of experience in 3D Unity engineer.<br>
   - Knowledge about 2D/3D physics, Animation, Textures, Model, Lightning,etc.<br>
   - Optimizing gameplay.<br>
   I currently have amateur knowledge about game coding(damage, health, player animations,) not the hard-coded ones since changing those could break the way the game operate. I also have a some experience in sound work with Audacity.<br>
   In order to pursue my ideal position, I need to learn in-depth about codes, learning animations, porting and optimizing materials, getting better at Math and many more at Maths which I have not known of.<br>

   <p>These test help me to understand more about myself including:<br>
   - From Myer-Briggs test: strength, weekness, workplace habits and career path which are helpful in the long run.<br>
   - From Educationplanner's learning style test: the most suitable way for me to learn with various solutions to benefit myself in class.<br>
   - From Big Five personality test: my most notable factors are Agreeableness and Conscientiousness.<br>
<p>In a team I can bring my carefulness to build concrete steps for every process and spotting out possible problems. I am also diligent so I can make sure every member in the team and my self will dedicate to the project as our primary goal to accomplish. I am quite friendly and optimistic when being around with others, which can help my teammates to feel at ease and optimistic as well. Whenever there is a conflict in the group, I can smoothen the pressure on both sides since we are working together, I do not want my teammates to be rude and disrespect to each other, which not only worsen our relationship but also have major impact on the result of the project we are working on.Even though I am open and friendly, I will not agree with everything people said without proper explaination and conviction.<br>
<p>When finding member for a team, I am looking forward to meet those who share the same passion in games (different interest might be harder to work together),dedicated, honesty and respect each other.<br>
<h2><b>Project Ideas</b></h2>
      <p>My project is about making a Co-op first person shooter horde mode game. In this game your mission is to fight and survive with your friends through waves of demons. This game will also have solo play with adjusted enemy spawns, the more people join the game (up to 4 people) , the more demons will summon from the depth of Hell.The game will be developed using Unity engine and released for Ios and Android platform.<br>
       <p>Videos games has always been popular in Personal Computer(PC) and PlayStation(PS) but nowadays, smartphone has already received various upgrades to make them compatible for playing video games. In both Appstore(Ios) and Google Play(Android) already numerous number of games to fit the demands of consumer. However, there is a lack of high-quality First Person shooter game(FPS for short), which is already popular for PC. Not many people these days have enough condition to build a gaming PC, laptop or PS so games for smartphone is a viable choice for these people. For PC and PS user, you can only play when you are at home but with smartphone, you can play your games everywhere: school, workplace, home, park, etc as long as you have enough battery and a stable Wifi connection for your phone.<br>
       <p>The gameplay is about shooting,slashing demons alone or with 4 of your friends together. There are 5 classes for players to choose: Assault, Support, Marksman & Berserk. Each class has its own power and features. The Assault is the backbone of the team, he can mow down mobs of fodder demons with his Assault rifles or Aubmachineguns. He also have the ability to deploy the ammo bag (have 4 charges)for the whole team to use. The Support is armed with Shotguns, which deals massive damage at close range, can send most demons flying. He has the most crucial equipment for the team, the first aid kit. This thing, although small but It can help bring back a limping or near-death teammate to keep on slaying demons. The next class is the Marksman, which served as the scout and taking out long range target. He can scan the unexplored, with his magnified scope attached to his Bolt-action rifles or Designated Marksmen rifles(semi-auto) to take out potential threats from afar. Without him, your team would have a high change of being ambushed by demons for not scouting the area before approaching. The final class is also the tankiest man in the team, the Berserk. Although only armed with the melee weapon, he is the one to wreck havoc to the demons of Hell. Berserk can choose various weapon from the arsenal (fist,sword, shield, axe, hammer, chainsaw,etc) but only 1 can be equipped. He is the protector of the team with the ability to absorb a sustainable amount of damage from demons. He is also the only member who can fight one-on-one with higher demons(bigger demon) while other members struggle. Although sounds overpowered, he need a dedicated medic to keep him patch up and survive longer in the battlefield. Most of the weapons from the game will be based on real-life weapons that I have research throughout the years. For example, Assault start-up weapons will be a AK-47, Support is the Remington M870, Marksman is the Remington M700 and Berserk is the Katana. For the enemies, I divide demons to 2 groups: Fodder(small demon) and Titan(big demon). Fodder will tend to swarm the players with numbers to overwhelm them but they are weak in health and damage. Although Hell does not have many Titan but quality is what define them from Fodder. Titans are a highly dangerous threat that requires teamwork to beat it, even Berserk can have a hard time dealing with this abomination without others' help. Serving as Hell prominient warrior, these Titans are armed with either a grinder or a blade to crush players with their hard-hitting attacks. After all players have survive all waves(number of waves could be selected), all will meet the final boss, the Lord of Hell. This creature is responsible for the invasion of Earth and the creation of demons. Again, teamwork is the key to obliterate the Lord and pushed the demons back to Hell. The Lord of Hell is the hardest opponent to all players. It can summons Fodder to aid it and distract players while it keeps on attacking. There are 2 kind of attacks. The first one it will smashed th ground causing it to shake and stumble all players in its radius, The Lord has a cooldown 5s before it can attack again. The second one is also the most powerful and non-predictable attack. It will charge at a random player and perform a close range attack(punching, smashing, kicking)which can hurt the victim to the verging of needing first aid kit. If everyone manages to defeat the Lord of Hell, players will be rewarded with weapons attachments that can be equiped to better enhance damage, accuracy and stability of the chosen gun. Instead of following the tradition difficulty scaling of every games(increasing enemies health and damage), I divided the game with 2 difficulties: Normal & Hard. In Normal, all enemies attack players with the base speed of 1x and 1x damage multipier. However, in Hard, all enemies will have a increase of 25% in speed and damage multipier with the increased in spawn numbers. Demons also gain new attack abilities which can make them harder to deal with. The hitpoints of all demons will be the same in all difficulties.(except the Boss health will be raised by 30%).All maps will be made out from both real-life locations and my own imagination (Hells, lava grounds, facility complex,etc).<br>
<p>The game will be developed and fully optimized by using Unity engine.<a href="https://unity.com/solutions/game">Unity 3D</a><br>
<p>Animations will be made by using Blender.<a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a><br>
<p>Game sounds will be created by using these tools.<br>
  <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a><br>
  <a href="https://freesound.org/">free recording sounds</a><br>
  My biggest obstacle is my knowledge and skills about Unity and Blender. I have never tried learning these two because I do not know how and where to start. I am still new to the IT field so my understanding are very limited. I have some basic skill in porting, mixing, merging audio files with Audacity but these are not enough to implement sounds to the game since Sound making is a tedious work. I also have limited knowledge about codes, which I think is the most crucial part for writing a game. In order to gain enough understanding to create a game, I need at least having mastered the basic of C++, Unity and Blender.<br>
  <p> If the game receives enough positive feedback and review from both reviewers and players, I believe it will bring a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction to the consumers. Being able to play a challenging co-op game with everyone or your friends whenever you are is surely a special experience. I hope people can give constructive reviews so I can keep updating the game with new features, bug fix and developing the next game if possible.
